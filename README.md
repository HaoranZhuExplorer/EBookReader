# EBookReader
A ebook reader uses Baidu Speech synthetise api to read ebook resources with a relatively natural accent

# Developing background
This days are pretty hard for me. I got Conjunctivitis these days and my eyes are always too tired to read books or write code.(After that, when I am writing this ReadMe file, I realize how I love writing codes.) I can only be focuesed to read books or work on computers for only  3 or 4 hours per day.

My life are pretty hard in many different ways these days.
In order to fuck this situation, I start to develop this project which can read ebooks(first version will mainly focus on PDF format) in a computer synthetise accent. It can help me read ebooks while my eyes are too tired to do anything.

It now uses Baidu's speech synthetise api to help me do the computer speech job soundly.
I'm working super hard this days. It's a hard time for me.

# Development process
step1: get context from pdf file(not done)
step2: use Baidu speech synthetise api with the context get from above and get byte[] music data(done) and use the sample code to convert the binary data to pcm format data.
step3: speak the byte[] music data get from above(not done)
